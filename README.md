# üê∂üê± Final AP Computer Science Principles Project  
### **By Michael Wu**

In this project, I develop a moderately deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Residual Units (~20 layers) to classify images of **dogs** and **cats**. The ultimate goal is to create an approach that will accurately classify images of dogs or cats fed into the ML model.

Although this is far beyond the scope of AP Computer Science Principles, I thought it would be a fun challenge to test my PyTorch ML Skills. This project is made to have ease of use and anybody with minimal programming experience should be able to run the notebook.

üìÇ **Dataset**: [Dogs vs. Cats (Kaggle Competition)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats/overview)

# Set Up Sets
```bash
conda create --name pytorch_ml python=3.11.2
conda activate pytorch_ml
conda install jupyter
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=pytorch_ml --display-name "PyTorch ML"
```

# Version Used
```bash
torch ==2.5.1
torchvision ==0.20.1
matplotlib ==3.10.1
numpy ==2.0.1
PIL ==11.1.0
tqdm ==4.67.1
```

# Example Predictions 




The steps enumerated below are the main idea for training and testing:

`1. Load in Data/Visualize Data`

`2. Do data transformations/turn images into tensors for training`

`3. Create the Machine Learning Model `

`4. Train the model for n epochs`

`5. Evaluate the model`

`6. Save the trained weights`

`7. Predict! `
